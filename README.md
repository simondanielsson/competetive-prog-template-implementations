# Competitive programming reference implementations

This repo contains reference implementations of various algorithms and data structures
useful for LeetCode/competitive programming.

Mostly implemented in Python, but you might also find implementations in other languages
(like OCaml).

Many of these are adapted from [cp-algorithms.com](https://cp-algorithms.com/) but
for Python, which is what I personally use most frequently.

## Validate the implementations

```bash
pytest tests
```
